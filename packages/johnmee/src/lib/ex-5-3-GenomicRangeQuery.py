GenomicRangeQuery

Find the minimal nucleotide from a range of sequence DNA

## Problem Description

https://codility.com/programmers/task/genomic_range_query/

## My Analysis

If you're not fussy, this is a straightforward problem: you go through every query and pull out the sliced sequence and
  inspect it.  A quick sort to identify the least impact nucleo and you're done. Right?  See 'slow_solution' below.
  It scores about 65/100.

No. Not done.

The straightforward solution visits every nucleotide in every slice. If the slices overlap a lot, then
  the solution revisits the same nucleotide a lot.  If you could arrange the solution to
  only visit each nucleotide once, then it would be much faster.

But how?

We need to pass over the sequence and produce an intermediatory data structure which aggregates the data we
need into a directly accessible form; namely, without stepping through any part of the sequence again.

Enter the "prefix sum" pattern.

For this problem, we create an array for each type of item, then at each step through the sequence, record
 the count of how many of each type we've seen.  When we're done, for the example sequence
 "CAGCCTA", we finish up with:

    sumA = [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,2]
    sumC = [0,1,1,1,2,3,3,3]
    sumG = [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]
    sumT = [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]

Now it's plain as day where each nucleo of each type appears.  So, when we can ask "Are there any
 'C' types between points 2 and 4?" we can lookup sumC for the answer:
  At point 2 we had seen 1 type C nucleo, and at point 4 we'd seen 2.  We determine
  there is exactly 1 (2-1) type C nucleo between points 2 and 4 only by looking at the two end-points,
  saving us from having to inspect every point between them.

So now we don't need the original sequence. Instead we can look at the sum for each endpoint
 and comparing the values.  Thus we can quickly identify which nucleotides appear in each query
 and determine the 'minimum impact' value within each.

See 'fast_solution'. Scores 100/100.
